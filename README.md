# nbhashtable
Our implementation of a Non-blocking Hashtable [as described by Chris Purcell and Tim Harris.](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11561927_10).

The Makefile is really simple. You might have to adjust the Makefile for Linux a little Chuck, or just terminal compile it manually. I haven't tested it on there.
