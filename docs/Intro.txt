Intro:
The non-blocking hashtable as described by Chris Purcell and Tim Harris describe a well designed concurrent hash table. The hash table described guarantees that at least one thread operating on the hash table will make progress. The hash table supports inserting elements, testing whether a specific element is in the hashtable, and deleting an item from the hash table. The hash table uses a system of upper bounds and buckets in order to facilitate searching for and deleting elements without the need to move elements once they've been placed in a bucket. Finally through the use of atomic "compare and swap" operations on state flags stored within the data, the hash table guarantees the abscence of data races while still guaranteeing that progress will be made by at least one thread.
